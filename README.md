# Crossy Road Project Final Project
<br /> - Player does not move when game is played (removed player start)
<br /> - Cannot spawn
<br /> - All vehicles move both left and right (random vehicles are created when game is played)
<br /> - All characters and props created in MagicaVoxel

#Crossy Road Final Turn-In
<br /> - It took time to run it through the SpaceSniffer software and delete the unnecessary files, let me know if you have trouble openning the .zip file (I may have deleted something I shouldn't have).
<br /> - Deleted Map2 and unused BP's
