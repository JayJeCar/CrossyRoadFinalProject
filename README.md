# Crossy Road Project Final Project
- Cannot spawn yet
<br /> - Player moves with keyboard action
<br /> - All vehicles move both left and right
<br /> - All characters created in MagicaVoxel

#Crossy Road Final Turn-In
<br /> - It took time to run it through the SpaceSniffer software and delete the unnecessary files, let me know if you have trouble openning the .zip file (I may have deleted something I shouldn't have).
<br /> - In the CrossyRoad.zip file I constructed two maps: Map is the actual game and Map 2 was for testing.
